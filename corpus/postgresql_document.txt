PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance. It supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) querying. PostgreSQL is ACID-compliant and transactional. It has a strong focus on standards compliance and extensibility. The pgvector extension adds vector similarity search capabilities to PostgreSQL, enabling efficient storage and querying of vector embeddings for AI applications.
