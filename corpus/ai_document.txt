Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that work and react like humans. Some of the activities computers with artificial intelligence are designed for include speech recognition, learning, planning, and problem solving. Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers to analyze various factors of data.
